# Scenario

A software development team is developing an online shop website. During the development process, the team has faced a number of difficulties, including inconsistent deployments, frequent bugs and errors, and troubled communication between the development and operations teams.
Releases have been delayed, and the website has experienced more downtime as a result of the slow and inconsistent deployments. Customer satisfaction has decreased as a result of the frequent bugs and errors, which resulted in negative user feedback. The development and operations teams' lack of cooperation has resulted in misunderstandings and delays in problem resolution.

To address the issues in this scenario, 3 DevOps practices can be used:

1. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment** (CI/CD): The team can automate the build, test, and deployment processes by using CI/CD, which will reduce the time and work needed for deployments. This may help increase the consistency and dependability of deployments, resulting in quicker releases and less website downtime.

2. **Automated Testing**: By using automated testing, the team can find bugs early on in the development process, lowering the possibility that issues will arise in production. This can help to raise customer satisfaction and improve the overall quality of the software product.

3. **Collaboration and Communication**: The team can decrease misunderstandings and delays in issue resolution by strengthening collaboration and communication between the development and operations teams. This can help the website run more smoothly and with less downtime. A shared responsibility DevOps culture can aid in developing a sense of accountability and ownership among team members.
