## The core principles and practices of DevOps

1. **Collaboration and Communication**
   DevOps is usually performed by a group of people, so it is important for this group to complete tasks together and support each other in case of troubles.
   Example: developers and operations teams must work together to ensure that code is properly tested and deployed.
2. **Continuous Integration and Delivery**
   Code changes must be continuously integrated into a shared repository and automatically deployed to production environments.
   Example: the newest update to the app should be merged into production and deployed, as soon as it is green lit for release.
3. **Version Control**
   Version control allows developers to track changes made to code over time and revert to previous versions if necessary.
   Example: GitHub has commits history that contains code changes and timestamp, which can be used for reverting code in case of some serious issues with newer code version.
4. **Monitoring**
   Monitoring is used to track system performance, identify issues, and troubleshoot problems.
   Example: By using monitoring, DevOps team can identify extremely high CPU usage and notify developers before the version is pushed into production and can potentially harm users.
5. **Continuous Learning from Feedback**
   The DevOps team should regularly review feedback from users, developers, and other operations teams, and use that feedback to make improvements to the development process.
   Example: Users can report issues with a particular feature, then DevOps teams will use that feedback to identify the root cause of the issue and make necessary changes to the code. This helps to ensure that future releases of the software are of higher quality and meet the needs of users.
